        <h1>On Love Found.</h1>
                <p>
                "Peace"<br>
I wasn't looking for love when I found you.<br>
I was actually looking for a way out of my broken blues.<br>
But there you were.<br>
I was sure you weren't looking for love as well.<br>
But here I am.<br>
As if the stars knew that we both needed one another.<br>
We found each other's peace.<br>
A symphony that we were both comfortable with.<br>
A song filled laughter with undeniable bliss.<br>
And if its not clear enough,<br>
You're the person I fell in love with.<br>
                     <br>
                     <br>
                    "I'd Choose You"<br>
Remember the times where you used to look at the window on a road trip?<br>
Thinking if there is someone out there you could spend the rest of your life with.<br>
Because I once did.<br>
I once held my hand open for someone to come in.<br>
And all that I got was a jar of thorns and a heart full of sin.<br>
I never thought a day like this would appear.<br>
That someone like you would heal.<br>
That someone's love would be all that I feel.<br>
 <br>
What if its us?<br>
What if its you and me?<br>
If I had every chance to choose you,<br>
Then I would choose you everyday.<br>
                </p>
