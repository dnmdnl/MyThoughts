        <h1>On Being In Love.</h1>
<p>
                "How You Remind Me"<br>
I have met so many people in my life that have made me fall in love.<br>
But you, you are the first that has made me stay in love.<br>
And I will be with you forever.<br>
When I don't know how I'm supposed to feel,<br>
you're the only person that can remind me.<br>
And I'm sorry I ever learned any words that make you cry,<br>
I'm still doing my best to learn the ones that make you smile.<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
"Ghosts"<br>
I'll see you at your funeral, if you'll see me at mine.<br>
    I'll wait at the edges for your ghost to rise until the end of time.<br>
    We'll find someplace nice to haunt,<br>
    an abandoned beach house filled with memories of summer sunburns.<br>
    Children will giggle as we tickle their feet at night,<br>
    and they'll never know the bad dreams we fight.<br>
    We'll make our own heaven,<br>
    walking in places we used to walk until death, dies.<br>
