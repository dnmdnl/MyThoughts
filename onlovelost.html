        <h1>On Love Lost.</h1>
<p>
                "I was happier with you, even if we never met"<br>
<br>
It was a cold day when the month started out.<br>
A broken thought with every silenced opening of my mouth.<br>
Afraid of the uncertainty of what might happen and what's to come.<br>
Then here comes a kind heart on a screen -- asking 'Is she the one?'<br>
<br>
For months I have thought that you were just an example of who I want.<br>
A figment of my imagination -- an impossible hunt.<br>
Then one day I figured out that you are not just an example but a need for me.<br>
A distant soul but will always seek out to see.<br>
<br>
I became as calm and quiet unlike the nights before my chained release.<br>
I guess that's the reason why I called you my peace.<br>
You became the reason why I wanted to exist.<br>
So don't ever say you're unworthy -- you're perfect to say the least.<br>
<br>
So I wanted to say thank you for being there.<br>
And I'm sorry for being unfair.<br>
I should've told you sooner -- or never.<br>
Because losing you would scar me forever.<br>
<br>
This poem was just supposed to tell you that I'm happy.<br>
And believe me -- You're someone I'll never regret.<br>
I hope that in your heart that you'd keep me.<br>
Because to be painfully honest ...<br>
I was happier with you -- even if we never met.<br>
