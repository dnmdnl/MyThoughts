        <h1>On Being In Love.</h1>
<p>
                "Grow as We Go"<br>
    I want to explain something,<br>
    something only a few people know.<br>
    Though I won't have time to tell you everything,<br>
    I guess we just have to grow as we go.<br>
    I dont love you for your beauty.<br>
    I dont love you for your smile.<br>
    I love you for the sake of love,<br>
    Even if it means I wont have it in return.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    "Purpose"<br>
    I want you to understand,<br>
    I do not mean to be annoying or to be a brat.<br>
    It's just that I've never had someone make me feel this way before.<br>
    And I know that this time it's real.<br>
    Is it too much to ask to see you everyday?<br>
    or to at least talk to you even if our mouths couldn't find a way?<br>
    I guess that's the purpose why in this book I stayed.<br>
    I could read it over and over again.<br>
