                    "You Matter"<br>
I was once in your footsteps,<br>
actually I still am.<br>
The one taking all the hits then blame yourself in the end.<br>
The pain which stole your peace peeks from time to time,<br>
pains me as well -- so I pray you'll be fine.<br>
<br>
I just want to remind you that you are valued, more than you think.<br>
To remind you not to blame yourself.<br>
"Napapagod na ako sa sarili ko", well I also am with myself.<br>
But it's people like you that gives me courage to give what's left.<br>
<br>
I'm very proud of you -- for being this strong.<br>
The way you look happy, like there's nothing wrong.<br>
But I can see it in your eyes, that thoughts wanted to come out.<br>
The problem is you just couldn't talk now.<br>
<br>
So I hope you'll learn who you are in our eyes.<br>
And the way God sees you, and gives you a smile.<br>
Saying "That is my daughter", wear that title with pride.<br>
End those tears with a prayer, for you are worthy inside.<br>
<br>
You are more than enough.<br>
Even with the troubles you face.<br>
You have a genuine heart, and thats what matters.<br>
You matter, always.<br>
                     <br>
                     <br>
                    "I Would Never"<br>
I keep on telling myself that this isn't love.<br>
It's just that I was waiting for so long for someone to come.<br>
I keep on telling myself that this isn't what I want.<br>
That all I wished for was for someone to understand.<br>
And after all this time,<br>
I was lying to myself.<br>
I knew for once that this was indeed love.<br>
Though never expected that it was you all along.<br>
Now I realized that this was really what I want.<br>
Because you are the only person that my brokenness could understand.<br>
After all this time,<br>
I found love.<br>
I found you.<br>
And I would never let you go this time.<br>
