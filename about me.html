        <h1>Hi, I'm Daniel.</h1>
                <p>
                I am a writter born and raised in the Philippines.<br>
                I have been writting ever since I can remember (or at least when I feel like it.)<br>
                As a kid, I loved listening to music and to read books.  I then went to write simple poems.  <br>
                    Maybe this is because I did not have much friends growing up so I used writting as an escape.<br>
                    These words help me to express myself without having to actually tell anyone about it.<br>
                    Time came when people told me to continue what I'm doing and to widen my audience.<br>
                    Since then, I used social media to express what I feel or to fit in other people's shoes.<br>
                    Now, I use this skill to let others be heard.  I not only write for myself but for others as well.<br>
                    and that is why ...<br>
                    These words are for you.<br>
